# Running 12 built-in ADC Channels Simultaneously on ESP32
A simple code to simulateously run 12 built-in ADCs on ESP32 at the same time.

# GPIO Functions:
I am using 12 GPIOs which have multiplexed functioning of ADCs

* GPIO36 ( ADC1 CHANNEL 0 )
* GPIO39 ( ADC1 CHANNEL 3 )
* GPIO34 ( ADC1 CHANNEL 6 )
* GPIO35 ( ADC1 CHANNEL 7 )
* GPIO32 ( ADC1 CHANNEL 4 )
* GPIO33 ( ADC1 CHANNEL 5 )

* GPIO25 ( ADC2 CHANNEL 8 )
* GPIO26 ( ADC2 CHANNEL 9 )
* GPIO27 ( ADC2 CHANNEL 7 )
* GPIO14 ( ADC2 CHANNEL 6 )
* GPIO4 ( ADC2 CHANNEL 0 )
* GPIO13 ( ADC2 CHANNEL 4 )

# Understanding the Flow:
* This code is developed for ESP32 on Embedded C Language using FreeRTOS.
* 

# Conclusion:
* There is nothing to conclude this time, it's super cool and works flawlessly ( unless you have not set the menuconfig properly and other including files like server certs files ).
* I hope you all like it :-D
